Annotation Web
====================================

Annotation Web is a web-based annnotation system made primarily for easy annotation of 
image sequences such as ultrasound and camera recordings.
It uses mainly django/python for the backend and javascript/jQuery and HTML canvas for 
the interactive annotation frontend.

Annotation Web is developed by SINTEF and Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and is released under a permissive [MIT license](https://github.com/smistad/annotationweb/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

You are more than welcome to contribute to this project, and feel free to ask questions.

## Main features
* Pure web-based system. Annotaters only need a web browser, they don't have to install anything, and everything is stored on the server.
* Fast and interactive annotation of temporal data/video using javascript and HTML 5 canvas.
* Secure login with two-factor authentication.
* Multiple annotation tasks are implemented, such image classification, segmentation using splines, landmark and bounding box.
